# Home-Repo
This is a Repository Visualization tool. Enter an organization in the search bar and if github has an api for it, it will retrieve a list of 
repositories for that organization sorted in descending order of star count.
Click on an entry in the list to expand the repository into a dropdown list and see the recent commits!
